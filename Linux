LINUX OS Basics:
Linux File System Structure : 
├── bin        -> essential binaries like ls, cp
├── boot       -> bootloader files
├── dev        -> device files
├── etc        -> config files
├── home       -> user home directories
├── lib        -> essential shared libraries
├── media      -> mounted devices like USB
├── opt        -> optional software
├── proc       -> process info (virtual filesystem)
├── root       -> root user’s home
├── sbin       -> system binaries (for root)
├── tmp        -> temporary files
├── usr        -> user apps and files
├── var        -> variable data (logs, mail)

/ – Root Directory
Master folder. Everything in Linux starts here.
Think of it like C:\ in Windows, but way more organized.
/bin – Essential User Binaries
🛠️ Contains basic user commands needed for the system to run even in emergency mode.
Examples:
•	ls, cp, mv, rm, cat, bash
Use Case:
•	When system is in rescue/recovery mode, these commands still work.
•	As a red teamer or forensic guy, if /usr gets corrupted, you still have basic tools in /bin to investigate or fix the system.
/boot – Boot Loader Files
🧬 Contains files needed to boot the system, like the Linux kernel, grub, initrd.
Examples:
•	vmlinuz – the actual kernel file
•	initrd.img – temporary filesystem loaded into RAM
•	grub.cfg – bootloader config
Use Case:
•	If you're analyzing a system that won’t boot, you'd check /boot for corruption.
•	Red teamers sometimes modify GRUB to maintain persistence 👀
